# Polarity

A 1-hour coding exercise. Read [PROBLEM.md](./PROBLEM.md) for the specification.

## Guidelines

- Use whatever language, framework, and tools you prefer (TypeScript/React suggested)
- AI coding assistants are encouraged—we want to see how you use them
- Ask clarifying questions at any time
- Focus on working software over perfect code
- Have fun, process is more important than perfection

## Getting Started

There is no starter code. Set up your project however you see fit.
